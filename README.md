# Neural Narrative

A hands-on machine learning journey documenting my learning path from foundational concepts to real-world projects. This repository covers supervised learning (regression & classification), ensemble methods, model evaluation, feature engineering, unsupervised learning, and complete ML project workflows with practical implementations in Python.

## What I've Learned

- **Supervised Learning - Regression**: Linear regression, polynomial regression, gradient descent, L1/L2 regularization, one-hot encoding
- **Supervised Learning - Classification**: Logistic regression, decision trees, SVM, Naive Bayes, multiclass classification, handling class imbalance, scaling, sklearn pipelines, precision/recall metrics
- **Ensemble Learning**: Random forests, gradient boosting, voting classifiers/regressors, XGBoost
- **Model Evaluation & Fine-Tuning**: Cross-validation (k-fold, stratified k-fold), ROC-AUC, GridSearchCV, model selection strategies
- **Feature Engineering**: Correlation analysis, VIF (Variance Inflation Factor), feature selection techniques
- **Unsupervised Learning**: K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, customer segmentation
- **ML Project Lifecycle**: End-to-end workflows including data cleaning, EDA, model training, error analysis, and deployment considerations
- **Real-World Projects**: Insurance premium prediction with complete pipeline from problem statement to solution

Each folder contains Jupyter notebooks, datasets, exercises, and solutions for practical, hands-on learning.
